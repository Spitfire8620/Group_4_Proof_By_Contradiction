Ex. 1:
Prove that 173 is an odd number


Ex. 2:
Prove that 9^(1/2) is a rational number


Walk-Through:
Example #1
Prove that 173 is odd.
PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
Assume The Negation
Assume 173 is even.

Use The Definition of an Even Number
Since 173 is even 173=2k where k is a whole number.

Solve for K
Therefore 173/2 = k should be true where k is a whole number.

Calculate to Check
However 173/2 =86.5 which is not a whole number.
Therefore saying 173 is even is a contradictory statement.

Conclusion
Therefore 173 is odd.



Example #2
Prove that 9^(½)/The square root of nine is rational
PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
Assume The Negation
9^(½) is irrational

Use the Definition Of an Irrational Number
Sine 9^(½) is irrational it cannot be written as a/b where they are integers and b≠0.

Rearrange To Solve 
9^(½) = a/b → 3b=a.

Use the Definition To Check
If 9^(½) is irrational then the answer after doing the operation not be rational however 3 is rational which is contradictory.

Conclusion
Therefore saying 9^(½) is irrational is contradictory.

Therefore 9(½) is rational.
